"Welcome to the *Carmina*, you will spend the first week of the summer program
for the Sea School on board. Here, you will go through the program orientation.

"We will have courses on the acting methods you will be using during the
rest of the program, as well as conducting character construction exercises.
Once the week is over, you will be expected to remain exclusively in character
24 hours a day during the first session.
