summary: |
    Orientation started so well, so let's see if that trend continues.
    Spoiler Alert: Not so much. The second day of orientation brings on
    the first meeting of the High Jump squad of the track and field team.
    Let's see how they like Ellie.

commentary: |
    <p>So that was a fun time...</p>
    <p>I mean, now we know why this is an actual story and not just a diary
    of some fictional engineering student's ostensibly normal life. Sorry for
    the darkness of that last few hundred words. This is basically one of
    the biggest fears for any closeted trans person. Especially if they
    dress in private. It's a terrifying thing to think that if someone sees
    the things that make you feel like yourself, feel real, then they might
    think you are a freak or something worse.</p>
    <p>For thousands of trans people, there is a constant internal struggle
    in order to convice oneself that their identity is real, not something
    perverted or freaky, or crazy. It doesn't matter how conviced they are
    that their trans identity is real, or how supportive their friends are,
    sometimes the struggle doesn't go away.</p>

The second day of Orientation starts early. Fuckface---I mean the RA,
Howard---serenades everyone with a terrible rendition of Beyonc√© at like
five a.m. (it was 7:30). Then we all split up for these "Freshman Prep"
sessions for each of our classes this term. These are little more than
syllabus readings, with the teachers---I mean professors---trying to
eliminate all ambiguity about what is expected of us.

We all meet back up for lunch and after, Fuckface leads the hall in some
ice-breaker activities, you know, games like *When the West Wind
Blows...* and such. Once we tire of that, everyone starts to do their
own thing. A few games of Ultimate break out on the quad, a few people
try to organize a pickup game of football, the works.

I join in with the Frisbee people---I played a little bit at Exeter
(only during the offseason, I would tell my coach). We start by just
throwing the disc around, and some of us definitely take the opportunity
to show off.

A bad throw sails high over my head, probably twelve feet in the air.
Turning, I take three steps into a running bound where I reach as high
as I can.

I meet the disc at my apex, my outstretch hand snatching the hard
plastic, now about a foot lower than before. As I descend, twist in the
air and send a backhand towards a girl across the circle from me.

It's off by a fair margin, but flies flat and true. I catch my landing
with my hand, saving my knees by distributing the weight to a third
limb.

Five minutes later, another dude one-ups my big leap by throwing an
accurate forehand, mid-backflip. The inverted disc rockets towards
Theo, who---in awe of the feat---fumbles the catch.

Eventually, enough people are interested to start a true game of
Ultimate. Backflip kid and the person who brought the Disc are captains,
picking playground-style. But while they argue about who should pick
first, I check my phone.

The first thing I notice is the time: 3:48. I'm very nearly late to the
first Captain's Practice for the track team. Since there are limits as
to when coaches can provide instruction to their athletes, specifically
that they need to wait until October to coach winter sports like Indoor
Track, the captains run practice autonomously until the coaches can step
in.

So I take off, back to my room. Since we hadn't left the quad near the
dorm, I didn't have to run far. Thankfully, I am already in decent
clothes. I grab my training shoes, as well as my spikes, my water
bottle, and a towel. Shoving them into my backpack, I take off running.

The one place whose exact location on campus I remember from my
recruitment visit is the track, so my strides are fast and true. I whip
out of the dorm, swinging off the door frame to keep as much momentum as
possible. I continue, running down the main road.

Quickly, I turn the corner to the track and vault the fence, skidding to
a stop in front of the rest of the team.

"Now that we're all here, let's get to know each other," a tall girl
with wavy brown hair starts. "I'm Michaela, I'm a senior, an APO
brother, and I'm a Chemical Engineering Major. I'm the Captain for the
jump squad and I only High Jump."

The tall blonde guy spoke next: "I'm Darnell, but everyone just calls me
Nells. I'm a senior, part of the Sigma Pi Fraternity, and a CS major. I
do long and triple jump."

The chiseled brown guy barely lets a second of silence go by before
speaking, "Yo, I'm Fernando Fitzgerald, Fitz. I'm a high jumper, but I
also vault sometimes. I'm a junior in Robotics Engineering."

"I'm Nicole. Nikki. I'm a junior, Mechanical. High Jump and Long Jump."

"Andrew Boone. Bones. I'm a sophomore, I haven't declared, but am
leaning towards Biomedical Engineering. Long Jump and the 100."

"Nadine Carlson. Just Nadine is fine. I do High Jump and Triple Jump.
Sophomore, Physics."

I'm next, but before I can speak, Michaela speaks up. "You three are our
newbies. Each of you are going to get one of us for a mentor. You know
the big/little thing in sororities?"

We nod.

"One of us is going to be each of your big. We wanna see you jump. We're
gonna ask you a bunch of questions, judge your fitness. Then we will
chose one of you, each. Those of us who choose the same will decide
which one gets you."

"Now introduce yourselves," says Nadine.

"I'm Ethan," I swallow. "Carver. I prefer either E, or Carver. I'm gonna
major in Aero/Astro. I'm a high jumper, mostly. I did the horizontals,
but I'm not as good at them."

"I'm Emma! Emma Giles. I'm undeclared right now, but I'll either do
Physics or Aero."

"Addison James. I do all the jumps. I'm double-majoring. Robotics
Engineering and Biomed."

Addison is from Choate, and he got twice the amount of interest as I did
as a freshman, and it only got bigger. He cleared 7 feet halfway through
senior year.

"Now run an easy 800!" Michaela commanded.

The three of us take the inner lanes and start to jog. They set a
slightly faster pace than I normally warm up at. Still slightly winded
from sprinting to practice, it's a bit of a struggle to keep up.

The upperclassmen take position on the outer lanes and take it easy down
the track.

When we finish, we all stretch.

"Okay, go put on your spikes."

While we're swapping our shoes, Fitz comes over. "Hows your first day
treatin' you?" His voice is musical.

I blink. "Pretty well. I mean, I almost forgot about practice while
playing frisbee. But it all seems pretty straightfohwahd."

"And your leg?"

"Oh it hasn't been particularly painful since the end of sophomore year.
But It's been harder to get its strength up than I had hoped."

"Um, well good luck on this."

"Uh, thanks."

"Alrighty, now. Vertical jumpers, let's go to the pit."

We walk to the red mats. The upperclassmen remove the covering
structure, and pull back the cover.

They put up the standards, and place a bar over the mat. "Dicky hates
this." I hear Nadine whisper to Michaela.

"Okay, what are y'alls steps?"

Emma goes first, "Eight, I jump righty." She stands in front of the mat,
by the left mark on the bar. She bounces away, pushing forward. On her
eighth step, she pushes up, and the rest of the team points where her
foot landed. Someone put a piece of tape down.

Then I go. "I'm weird, nine, on my left."

I burst away from the right side of the mat, counting aloud with each
step as I accelerate away.

Addison says "You got a tape measure?" Nells nods. "Fourteen feet five
out, another 65, two and a half back."

They do out the measurements.

"Emma, we start at 4'10 today."

She nods, nervous. As she walks to her start, I pat her on the shoulder.
"You got this."

Once she gets to her spot, she hops up twice before taking the starting
position, her right foot in front.

She takes three steps before beginning to curve around. Throwing her
final step at the ground, she pops up and over the bar, barely clearing
it. She rolls off the mat, placing her feet gingerly on the surface.

"Take your time. Next height is five feet even, unless you wanna skip
it."

"No, I'm fine." She catches her breath, and runs around in a few tight
circles before taking her starting point again. Two small hops, then she
crouches again for the start.

She clears the height again, but only after the bar bounces up and kindly 
returns to it's spot on the standards. She hit it. At 5'2," she slips
over the bar, leaving it quivering. 

"Now 5'4". We're starting you guys next height, be ready."

"Can I skip it," asks Addison.

"Nope."

Two more hops. This time Emma plows into the bar.

"Your up now, E!"

I take a deep breath. I stand on my mark. I touch my toes. I jump up and
pike my legs. I do both again. I crouch over my leading right leg.
*One.* I throw myself forward. *Two.* My other leg pushes off the
ground. *Three.* One more push, accelerating. *Four.* Top speed. I pull
my torso up, and lean. *Five.* I turn towards the mat. *Six.* More
turning. *Seven.* I tense. *Eight.* Penultimate step. I drop my center.
*Nine.* My left leg slams into the ground I lift in the air. My angular
momentum spins me. I arch over the bar. Kick. My shoulders slam into the
mat.

"Good," says Nells. "Faster next time."

Addison flies over the bar. No warmup, no ritual.

They raise the bar. Addison passes. 5'8 is the highest I'd jumped since
my injury. I get ready. Bend, pike-jump. Bend, pike-jump. Crouch. Power.
Turn. Penultimate. Jump. Arch. Kick. Land.

5'10. Addison goes first. He clears easily. I start again. Ritual.
Crouch. Run. PAIN! I come up short, clutching my calf. I sit down.

Everyone rushes over to me. "You OK?" It's Bones.

I shake my head. Michaela gestures to Nikki and Nels. "Bring him to the
trainers. They'll figure it out."

"But we aren't in season."

"He's part of a varsity team, they'll treat him."

They grab a hand apiece and pull me up. Nells stands on my left, and
bears the weight I'd put on my painful leg.

Nikki helps on the right, supporting me between steps. We get to the
bottom floor of the Gym, and they help me into the trainers' office.

They help me onto a table. A trainer comes out. "What happened?"

"He came up short on an approach, the pain seems to be coming from his
left calf."

The trainer steps over to me. "Where is the pain, exactly?"

I trace a line from my mid-calf to my knee, on the outside of my lower
leg. He nods. He pulls out a roll of tape and applies it with with a
deft hand. "Don't put any weight on it outside of practice for a week.
No running at greater than a jog, and only use treadmills or a bike for
30 minutes at most. Come in for heat before practice, at least 30
minutes. Then get ice after. We'll tell you when you can stop."

I nod. "How am I gonna keep from putting weight on my leg?"

As I expected, he pulls out a pair of crutches. "These are your new best
friends."

He wraps some ice on my leg, taping it there, with a piece of paper
towel between the baggies of ice and my skin.

"Now go and get some rest."

I look to Nikki and Nells. "I'm sorry."

"Go home. It's fine."

I'd gotten used to crutches when I tore my quad, so I pick them up and
start ambling back to my dorm.

It takes a while. Limping around on crutches is much slower than
sprinting at full tilt.

It's fully dark by the time I get back to Falley Hall. I take the
elevator up to the second floor. I see it all sprawled across the common
room floor. All of my gear. Everything.

"Freak!"

"Tranny!"

"Pervert!"

"Get out!" I scream it at the top of my lungs. "Fuck off!" I brandish a
crutch. Something in my eyes, or maybe just the five foot long piece of
aluminum flailing around scared them enough to get them away.

I gather everything up, tears welling in my eyes. It takes two trips.
I'm ignoring the orders of the trainers, leaving my crutches leaning
against the wall of the common room while I hobble around, picking up
all of my stuff, and returning it to its proper location in my own room
in the tower. It's slow, and it's painful work. Once I put the last of
it away, I grab my crutches, bring them back, and collapse onto my bed,
tears flowing freely now.

KNOCK! Someone is at the door. "Carver? You OK?"

It was Diane's voice. I wiped at my face. "Yeah." It sounded anything
but sincere. "The door's unlocked. Come in."

"Sure."

She steps through the door, seeing me curled up on my bed. "I'm sorry,"
she says. "I should have stopped it."

"You could have? Who did this?"

"A couple of people down the other end of the hall. They're buttholes."
She pulls out my desk chair and sits next to the bed. Her eyes fall on
my taped and iced leg. "Oof. That doesn't look good."

"Yeah, I fucked up my ankle in the first captain's practice. What a
first day, amiright?" My smile doesn't come close to reaching my ears, 
my heart not really in the expression.

"Wow. I'd almost say that the ISTU is out to get you."

"Nah. People just suck. And I'm prone to injury." I shrug. "I'll be
okay tomorrow, and I'll be walking unassisted by the end of the week."

She narrows her eyes. "Fuck that. No one is okay eight hours after *that*.
It's going to take more than just a bit of sleep."

"I could go for a nostalgic Disney movie right about now." The smile is
a little more real this time.

She laughs. "When aren't people up for Disney? Just us, or do you think
that the rest of the suite should join up?"

"Ummm..." I languish for a second, "everyone. Why not? It's not like they
were the asshats that went through my stuff."

She grimaces a bit. "So what movie do you think? *Leelo and Stitch*?
*The Hunchback of Notre Dame*? *The Emperor's New Groove*? *Frozen*?"
She chuckles. "I'm kidding. Or is there something else?"

"Let's go with *Hunchback*."

"Yo," she yells out the door. "Who's up for watching *The Hunchback
of Notre Dame* as a suite tonight?"

Voices respond affirmatively, and we go to the common room and hook
a Netflix account up to the TV.


Captains' Practice Playlist
---------------------------

After the disaster that was Carver's day at the ITSU, the playlist for
the night definitely reflects their crappy mood.

Halestorm starts the night off, a staple in Carver's playlists since
high school.

ISTU Track Team Overview
------------------------

The ISTU track team is, in the scheme of New England DIII schools,
actually pretty good. Led by the strength of their throwers---mostly Air
Force ROTC cadets---they do pretty well in a number of post-season
meets. However, they are quite small in comparison to a number of other
local schools, with a team of only 60 people.

Coached by Mildred Vass, a former Javelin star for UT-Irvine, the team
often has to compete for practice space with both varsity sports and
clubs of all sorts.
