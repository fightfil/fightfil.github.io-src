  Where the prologue introduced you to only one important character,
  Ellie this first chapter brings in a totally new collection of people.
  I'm interested to know your reaction to them, so please leave a comment
  below.
  
  Keep on keeping on.

The auditorium's simple doors belie the enormity of the chamber they conceal.
The ever-painful Hartford traffic made me a tad late, so I enter the hall
already full, the stadium seating already containing hundreds of parents, dozens
of professors and staff, and even a smattering of returning students. A giant
sign points to where the freshman are sitting---on the stage. There is nary
an empty seat left. But I find *a* chair, between a lean, springy-looking, guy
and a chick whose flowing mane puts even lions to shame.

As my backside lands on the hard plastic, the loudspeakers crackle to life:

> Welcome, class of 2020, to the Igor Sikorski Technical Institute! Some of the
> most important years of your life are beginning, and we are thrilled that you
> have chosen to come here to spend them! You are participating in a tradition
> of excellence that is as strong as you'll find anywhere, even if it is younger
> than many of the other schools that you might also have considered.

The speck of a woman standing at the podium, giving the freshman class its
welcoming address, is Dr. Emma Culpek, the school's President: she was on
the team at SpaceX that developed reusable rockets before she joined the school
this summer.

> You haven't quite made it to real life yet, but for most of you this will be
> your last stop before you get a job, start your career, and begin to change
> the world. In just four short years, many of you will be working with the
> most cutting edge technologies and research in the world. You all will have
> learned more than any of us have ever known, and the world shall belong to
> you.
>
> As I speak, returning students are helping your parents put all of your stuff
> in your rooms and when we are done here, you will be able to start getting to

Tedium engulfs the room. For the next 80 minutes, stuffy lecturer after stuffy
lecturer graces our privileged asses by spelling out how, exactly, we will be
enjoying our time at the ISTU. *Not like we haven't researched everything to*
*do with this place while agonizing over which school to go to or anything.*
Not even the inevitable snickering and whispered conversation can break the
monotony of Dean after Dean giving endless tips about how to go about studying,
why torrenting is a **Bad Idea^(c)^**, or how to **Enjoy Yourself at a Party
Without Drinking(tm)**. Slowly, agonizingly, the presentations
draw to a close.
The auditorium doors swing open, our portal into this new world of college life,
once step away from the **Real World^(r)^**.

As we step out into the sun, heat bearing down on us, our path to freedom is
blocked by a dozen or so tables, each sporting a letter or two. A girl in a
sorority shirt---Alpha Xi Delta---stands in front of them with a megaphone.
"Go to the table with the first letter of your last name! Pick up your keys and
ID's!." She repeats that ad nauseum---she'll lose her voice before the day is
out.

"Ethan" \*cringe\* "Cahvah," I say, once I've reached my table. "ID number
443455432."

"Wow," the table-sitter says, "you've memorized your ID already. That'll come in
handy. But I just needed your name. Let me see here," she's ruffling through a
box of small envelopes. "Here we are. Your ID is in here, along with the key to
your room. It's in Falley Hall, 201 D. It's on the east end, a room in one of
the tower suites."

"Cool," I say, lacking any more articulate a response. Grabbing the envelope, I
start off to my dorm. Of course, I have no idea where I'm going, so I stop at
the campus map first. It's conveniently located just outside of the auditorium
parking lot. Falley Hall is pretty close, just on the South Campus.

I set back off towards it. Being move-in day, all the doors are wide open and I
don't yet need my ID or keys to get in, so I stride right through the door,
down the hall, and up the staircase. Falley Hall is mildly castle-like, flanked
by octagonal towers that extend a story above the rest of the building.

My tower is on the side closer to the lake, so once I find myself on the second
floor, I step in. The common area isn't large, just enough for a couch and TV,
but it's separate from the rest of the dorm. I see my door, 'D', so I step in.
All of my stuff is stacked neatly beside the bed. I got the single that I wanted
so badly, so I wouldn't need to negotiate anything with a roommate.

My computer bag is on top, so I swing that over to my desk. I pull it out: The
IT director showed us how to connect to the network during the presentations, so
at least it that hour wouldn't go entirely to waste.

"Yo! E'rybodayyy!" The voice booms from down the hall, exuberant and bouncy.
"Ya'll need to come out and come to the First Year Barbecue. All y'all will be
sitting with your neighbors and gettin' ta know each otha'." I stick my head
out the door, looking to get what was going on out in the hall. My room is
angled in such a way that I can see little from there, so I head back out.

Standing in the middle of the hallway, clad in a baggy neon shirt emblazoned,
in two rows of letters, with ITSU FXA on its chest, is Howard Lyons. I remember
him from my recruitment visit last winter, while I was still deciding which
school I'd choose.

"Howard?" I say, doubtful he'd remember *me*.

"If it ain't the washed-up wonda! What's new, Carver." *Oh God, I almost
forgot about that nickname*. I had gotten it when I tore my quad after a couple
years of really promising performances in high school. I was getting real
interest from some DI schools back then. But I never came back the same. I
really was a 'washed-up wonder'.

But self-pity gets me nowhere, so I focus on the conversation that I am supposed
to be having: "Well, I'm happy to finally be here. It's really surreal. I think
I'm still riding the high of graduating."

"I know that feel. It may have been three years ago, but I don't think I'll ever
forget graduation. Now get'chyo' ass over to the barbecue."

Instinctively, I hop to it. There's something about instructions from experienced
athletes that just makes me act without hesitation or question. *Or you might*
*have a thing for him.* No I don't have a thing for him. He's too chunky---too
much of a *hunk*.

The quad is a sea of umbrellaed tables: each one emblazoned with the crest of
one or another of the freshman dorms. Falley Hall's is fairly simple: a computer
on a shield. The style of computer indicates the floor. The second floor gets the
late-nineties kind: a beige tower along with one of the old tube displays.[^1]

[^1]: The first floor gets an early eighties style terminal computer. 3rd floor gets
    a laptop, while the 4th floor (just the towers) are either represented by a
    punch card or a tablet.

I find a table with one of the nineties-style computers on the umbrella and sit
down. Moments later, a short red-headed guy walks up: "Do ya mind if I sit
here?"

"Nope. There's more than enough room here. I'm Ethan, but ever since I had a
class with 5 other Ethan's in it, I've gotten into the habit of just using my
last name: Cahvah."

"Carver?"

"Ayuh."

"Nice to meet you. I'm Kyle Talbott."

"That name rings a bell." I remember reading the name before---on the email that
told us our room assignments during the summer. "Oh! You're in my suite!"

"So that's why Howard was enthusiastically steering me this direction."

"Probs. He's a bit exuberant."

Just as we are getting comfortable around each other, another new face butts in.
"Hiya!" She is tall---taller than me---with flowing golden hair, and a smile
that could warm even the coldest days. "I'm Diane Mesker. Howard told me to go
here. Though his exact words were something more like: See that table with the
chubby red-head and the string-bean? I better not see your ass anywhere else."

"'Ass' *is* his favorite word. I'm Ethan *Carver*," this time I take extra care
to enunciate the 'r's, "Though I tend not to use 'Ethan' much."

"And I'm Kyle Talbott. I just go by Kyle."

"Ha. 'K. Kyle and Carver. Got it.

"So where are you all from?" This is Kyle, for the record. "I was born in
Sturbridge, but my family moved to Boulder, Colorado, before I started high
school."

"Born and raised in Rockport, Maine," I say, "the only town in the state to have
residential fiber internet."

"Never heard of it." That voice is new. We all turn, a tiny bit startled, to see
a new guy standing just behind Kyle. "Yo," He says. "I'm Theo. ...Welk. I'm
from Stamford. I think I'm rooming with you, Kyle."

"Oh, really? So that Stratocaster is yours? Man, that thing is sweet!."

"Thanks." He isn't particularly enthusiastic about the praise. But before an
awkward silence can fall, he turns to Diane, "And are you Jen or Diane?"

"I'm Diane, and before you butted in, I was gonna say that I'm from Glastonbury,
and I'm here with my twin sister, who is staying in Kepler."

"Ooh, fancy. I'm Ethan Carver, by the way, in case you haven't guessed. But call
me Carver, please. I got used to it in high school and I don't know, I just like
it better."

"Why don't we sit?" says Kyle, acting the pragmatist. Diane and I sigh, happy
that we don't have to be the ones to suggest it. We all turn to face our chairs,
meaning to sit down, and see that someone sat at the table while we were
talking.

"Hi guys," Her voice barely penetrates the low din of the dozens of surrounding
conversations. "I'm Jen. I'm from Poughkeepsie---my mom teaches at Marist."

"Wow, good job sneaking up on us," says Theo. "We didn't even know you were
there."

"Yeah, sorry."

All sitting now, I try to continue breaking the ice. "Does everyone know what
they'll major in?"

Diane barely waits for me to finish the question. "Robotics, with a biotech
focus."

Theo is also pretty quick to answer. "Computer Science, definitely, but I don't
know if I want to focus in Robotics, or AI, or even Physics."

"I'm going to do Aero/Astro and focus on Physics, with a minor in Lit."

"Fancy..." This is Kyle. "I'm going to do a double major, Electrical
Engineering, and Chemistry. Their focuses are each other, so that's fun. And I
think I'm gonna get a Theatre minor, and maybe also do something with Math."

"Who's fancy, now?" I retort. "So tell me all about this life that you are never
gonna have."

"Hey!"

"What about you, Jen?" asks Diane.

"Oh, I'm still deciding. This term, I'm taking a bit of everything---Data
Structures, ODE's, Intermediate Mechanics, and Intermediate Genetics."

"Fuck." Theo receives a few glances. "Those are hard classes. I'm not even gonna
be able to take Data Structures until the third trimester."

Jen's lips twitch, the faintest hint of a smile gracing her face. *ODE's? I*
*might have that class with her!*

"Who do you have for Differential Equations? We might be in the same class."

"Renler, I think. At 2 on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays?"

"Ayup! Wicked. I won't be totally alone in theah then."

"What classes is everyone else taking?", Jen asks, "Maybe we all won't be
alone."

"Well besides ODE's," I start, "I'm taking German I, Early Speculative Fiction,
and Stress Analysis."

"There's only the one intro German class, right?" Asks Theo---when I nod, he
says, "So we'll be together for that. I'm in Introductory Programming, Calculus
2, and Technical Writing I as well."

Kyle lights up at the last two: "I'm in Calc 2 and Technical Writing too. I'm
also taking Introductory Electricity and Magnetism and Chem 2."

"What about you, Diane, are you in any of our classes?"

"No. I'm in Calculus 3, Intro to Robotics, Biology 2, and Music Composition I"

"Um, guys, I think we've been missing out on the food---see all those dudes with
their plates piled high food?" Theo finally brings us all back to the main
purpose of this gathering---the BBQ.

We all get up---Theo leads the pack at a brisk walk, letting no one get in
between him and his food. It's standard barbecue fare: burgers, corn, melon,
chips, ect. Before to long, we're back at our table, chowing down.

"So you play guitar?" Diane asks Theo, starting the conversations back up.

"Yeah. Well..." He doesn't look enthused about talking about his musical past.
"I was in a band in high school. We even toured around a bit. But the rest of
the band chose to go to UCLA for college, while I was left alone going here.
They kinda abandoned me, so it's been hard to stay interested in playing."

"That sucks. I sing a little and have a bit of experience with a couple
instruments, so if you ever wanna jam..."

"Sure. So what will the rest of you be doing when you aren't 'hard at work'."

Diane and I speak almost at once: "Basketball." "Track."

Jen says, "I'll probably destroy my free time with theatre!"

My brain immediately envisions the girl whispering her way through the "O, what
a noble mind" soliloquy. I banish the unfair imagery and ask, "Musical theatre,
or plays, or do you do tech?"

"I love me some musical theatre. But I also do a lot of stage design and
building for tech."

"What about you, Kyle."

"I, uh, play video games." He looks seriously intimidated by all of our
well-lain-out plans for extracurricular activities. "and I am a big pen and
paper nerd. I've been known to GM a game or two before."

"Which games do you do?" Asks Jen.

*Please don't be lame and just say D&D* "Well, I've kinda gotten tired of the
more mainstream ones like D&D or Warbane[^2],so now, I mostly homebrew, but 
I recently tried **Mind Phase**, which is pretty good."

[^2]: I will be coming up with parody names for games and some other stuff.
    Not for any particular reason---you may have noticed I'm not changing
    the names of companies like United Technologies, Sikorski Aircraft, 
    or SpaceX---but so that there is a personal flair to the world. I guess
    it is also so that if I put actual gameplay in the story, people won't
    be like "That's not how it's played", or something. Thus, I introduce you
    to Warbane, a parody of the Warhammer universe of games.

The average observer might not recognize it, but upon hearing the words **Mind**
**Phase**, something clicks in our group. Each of us perk up at the mention of
the game. It's a cyberpunk RPG system with a lot of really good mechanics for
dozens of Sci-Fi tropes[^3].

[^3]: This is a fictional system loosely based off of a (made-up) hybridization 
    of *Mindjammer* (by Sarah Newton) and *Eclipse Phase*. Both are good 
    role-playing systems in their own rite, but they are somewhat similar in scope,
    and have some shortcomings. However, those shortcomings are different and each
    game's weaknesses are strengths in the other one, so I may try to formalize this
    said system.

We all blurt, "We *need* a campaign of this," at once.

"You've heard of it?" Kyle was incredulous at us---jocks and theatre and band
geeks---being in to the pen-and-paper scene at all.

Jen nodded---almost sagely, "I was at the con where Pascal and Yates unveiled it.
My mum got to playtest it---she loved it."

"Well we know what we're going to be doing in whatever free time we have, then,"
I say, excited now.

"Definitely," says Kyle. "But I'm going to have to spend a while to get a
campaign ready. We'd to have a real universe built up before there'd be any hope
of a great campaign."

"Ooh, I love world-building." Theo's lips finally broke into a smile---making me
realize that he had not yet done so throughout our whole meal.

"Then you should definitely give me a hand," says Kyle, who appeared to also take
note of Theo's demeanor.

Noticing that our plates were quickly emptying, I ask, "Does anyone remember
what we are scheduled to do after this? I only barely read the schedule in the
first place."

"Um, chill?" Kyle's voice is hopeful---he hasn't a clue.

"I think we have department presentations next," Theo suggests.

"Yeah, after those, we can meet up for dinner?" Jen's cheeks flush a little.

"Totes," answers Diane.

Getting up, we bring our plates to the trash and head our separate ways.

# Freshman Orientation Playlist
