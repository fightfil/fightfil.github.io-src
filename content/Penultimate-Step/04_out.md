"...Then I was selected Senior Speaker for our commencement ceremonies
and Kara and I ripped my graduation gown apart and turned it into a
elegant dress on the way to coming out to the entire school. My dad
still don't know, though. He wasn't there."

"What about your mom?"

"I haven't seen her since I was like five. She left me and my dad soon 
after I was born, and then tried to sue for custody when I was four. 
The suit lasted forever..."

"That sucks."

"Meh. You don't miss what you never had. Dad tried hard, and we had some
good times, but he's a fairly conservative Baptist, and I'm not sure how
accepting he'll be when I finally do tell him."

"He'll come through. But I can see why you're hesitant."

"But for now, I don't really care, I just want to try to find a way to
be myself here, while taking part in the stuff that I want to. Once I
do that, then it won't be so hard to face the prospect of my Dad."

"Hold up now," says Kyle. "You just said that you did *what* to you
graduation robes?"

"I cut them apart and sewed them back together in the form of a dress."

"And this was *allowed*?"

"What were they going to do? Not give their senior speaker a diploma? I 
owned the gown, and there weren't extras, so they couldn't have made me 
change."

"Yeah, I guess you had them cornered. But weren't you worried that they'd
actually bring the hammer down?"

"I was fucking terrified. But it did work out in the end, so all's well
that ends well. Then I gave the speech of my life, coming out as trans
in front of the entire school, and most everyone's parents.

"It was one of the best experiences of my life to recieve that ovation
afterwards. On the opposite end of the spectrum was yesterday. I guess
that goes to show how much better it is to come out on my own terms."

"Oh, definitely," says Jen. "During junior year, my mom---not knowing I was
gay, mind you---caught me with my girlfriend, doing a bit more than kissing,
one evening. She was fairly supportive, but that was an experience I'd rather
not repeat."

"That must have been scary." Daine looks, with concern, at Jen.

"I mean, I had expected Mum to be okay with it, but all the same, yeah, kinda."

"So," says Theo, "how are we going to celebrate our last night of freedom before
the term starts?"

"Um, curl up in a ball and cry?" suggests Jen.

"Get plastered and streak across campus?" We all laugh at Kyle's contribution.

"Catch up on our Netflix backlog like the trash we are?" I add.

"Ooh, I like that one," says Diane.
