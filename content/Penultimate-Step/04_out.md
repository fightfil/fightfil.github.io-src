"...Then I was selected Senior Speaker for our commencement ceremonies
and Kels and I ripped my graduation gown apart and turned it into a
elegant dress on the way to coming out to the entire school. My dad
still doesn't know, though. He wasn't there."

"What about your mom?"

"I haven't seen her since I was like five. She left me and my dad soon 
after I was born, and then tried to sue for custody when I was four. 
The suit lasted forever..."

"That sucks."

"Meh. You don't miss what you never had. Dad tried hard, and we had some
good times, but he's a fairly conservative Baptist, and I'm not sure how
accepting he'll be when I finally do tell him."

"He'll come through. But I can see why you're hesitant."

"But for now, I don't really care, I just want to try to find a way to
be myself here, while taking part in the stuff that I want to. Once I
do that, then it won't be so hard to face the prospect of my Dad."

"Hold up now," says Kyle. "You just said that you did *what* to you
graduation robes?"

"I cut them apart and sewed them back together in the form of a dress."

"And this was *allowed*?"

"What were they going to do? Not give their senior speaker a diploma? I 
owned the gown, and there weren't extras, so they couldn't have made me 
change."

"Yeah, I guess you had them cornered. But weren't you worried that they'd
actually bring the hammer down?"

"I was fucking terrified. But it did work out in the end, so all's well
that ends well, I guess. Then I gave the speech of my life, coming out as trans
in front of the entire school, and most everyone's parents.

"It was one of the best experiences of my life to recieve that ovation
afterwards. On the opposite end of the spectrum was yesterday. I guess
that goes to show how much better it is to come out on my own terms."

"Oh, definitely," says Jen. "During junior year, my mom---not knowing I was
gay, mind you---caught me with my girlfriend, doing a bit more than kissing,
one evening. She was fairly supportive, but that was an experience I'd rather
not repeat."

"That must have been scary." Daine looks, with concern, at Jen.

"I mean, I had expected Mum to be okay with it, but all the same, yeah, kinda."

"So," says Theo, "how are we going to celebrate our last night of freedom before
the term starts?"

"Um, curl up in a ball and cry?" suggests Jen.

"Get plastered and streak across campus?" We all laugh at Kyle's contribution.

"Catch up on our Netflix backlog like the trash we are?" I add.

"Ooh, I like that one," says Diane.

"Hey, can someone spot me an advil," I say, a propos of nothing---besides
a lingering pain shooting up my calf. "I forgot to get some at the bookstore
today and my leg is *killing* me."

"Ooh," replies Jen. "I think I might have a bottle of ibuprofen in my bag."

She gets up and skips to her room. Emerging from the doorway after a few 
moments, she hands me a bottle of the tablets. 

As I pop one, she asks, "So how bad is it anyways?"

"During practice today, the trainer was thinking I'd be out for about ten days,
which is about typical for a muscle strain. The last one I got kept me sidelined
for just about a week, so we'll see."

"You athletes..." Theo scowls at me and Diane. "All injuries are just, 'I'll be
resting for a couple days, then I'll be in tip-top shape, raring to get hurt
again'."

Diane and I exchange looks. "He's not *entirely* wrong," she says.

"You guys don't even let yourselves acknowledge that getting hurt, well *hurts*.
It's like you people just try and turn it into no big deal, even when any
normal person would be lying in bed, lamenting how their life is over, if they
were in your shoes right now, Carver."

"That's because---" He cuts me off before I realize that I have no argument
for that.

"You athletes are just masochists, plain and simple."

Diane snickers. "Nah, that's not the side of the dynamic that gets me freaky."

None of us can keep it in. Even Kyle snorts in the corner.

"And, on that note," she says, "I'm going to bed!"

We scatter, taking turns at the bathroom to clean up and prepare for our first
classes in the morning.

* * *

The blaring of the alarm makes me jump out of bed---much to my calf's protest.
I throw a light shirt on over my bare torso, grab my towel and toiletry bag,
and limp out of my room to the bathroom.

I thank the stars for my luck that no one else is using it, and close the door 
behind me. I turn on the water to the shower, and start brushing my teeth. The
stream is scalding when I finish, so I turn the heat down a tiny bit before
stepping in to rinse off.

Wrapped in my towel, I exit the bathroom, greeted by the flushed face of Diane,
still breathing heavily from a morning run. Her shoulders, dripping with sweat,
really stand out when she's wearing only a sports bra, the bulging muscles
quivering with fatigue. "Shower's all yours," I manage, barely pulling my eyes
away from her.

I slip back into my room, extra-conscious of my bare chest. Shaking out my hair,
I dry off any last vestiges of dampness before throwing on a golf shirt and 
jeans. Backpack slung over one shoulder, I grab my crutches and head out into
the hall.

My phone buzzes, alerting me to the time, 8:45. So I start ambling across campus
to my first class of my college career: Intro Materials Science.

It's really hard to blend in amongst the crowd when you are relying on the
support of a pair crutches. The hundreds of students headed to class step aside,
parting the seas for my limping gait.

The whispers aren't present. *Yet.*

My class is on the second floor of Costner Hall. I lean on my crutches in front
of the elevator, waiting with a number of other students for the doors to open.
They see me, or at least my crutches, and make room for me, indicating that I'll
be let on first---or at least I hope as much.

My hopes are confirmed when the the elevator doors open with a ding a few 
moments later, allowing entry. I step in, followed by several other students,
until we are all packed in the small area like so many sardines. The next ding
opens the door on the second floor, where I step into a hallway which appears
to have the singular purpose of opening up into a 200-seat lecture hall, which,
conveniently enough, is the precise room I need to be planted in for the next
90 minutes.

I amble down to the 6th row, still in the front quarter of the hall and take a
seat on the right side of the main body of seats, despite the two wings on
either side being much emptier.

I put the crutches in the seat to my right, leaving only one seat between my
crutches and the aisle. As I'm getting situated, a young woman with thick,
rimmed, glasses tosses a gym bag on the table in front of the lecture hall and
assumes her position at the lectern.

"Hello everyone, I'm Erica Entwistle, and I'm teaching Intro to Materials 
Science this term." She pauses, then adds, "So if you are in this classroom and
are *not* planning on taking this class, while you are more than welcome to
stay, I'm sure you have things you would rather do than have me talk to you
about the workings of different metals and plastics during the next ninety 
minutes.

"Alternatively, if you are not currently signed up for the course, but want to
be, come to me right after class with your add/drop slip, and I can sign it for
you."

One person, looking bewildered and overwhelmed, hastily shoves his books
back into his bag before rushing out of the lecture hall, red-faced.

The remainder of the class is much less eventful---Professor Entwistle proved
to be an excellent lecturer, but nothing out of the ordinary happened---and
I am almost surprised to see how much time is passed when she announces that
she is done for the day, and that she expects to see us at Friday's lecture.

Then comes the unenviable ordeal of packing my books back up, getting my 
crutches free from the chair, and hobbling out of the lecture hall. I have a
free period of three hours, which I start by heading to lunch.

I put a message in the suite's group chat to say that I'll be at the dining
hall, but if my memory serves me, most of them have their own class during
this time. It only takes a minute before I see their apologies flood back,
filling my notifications with the names of all the classes that conflict
with a normal eating schedule. "Too bad," I text back. "you're all missing
out on the best lunch yet." I haven't even made it through the line into
the dining hall.

I'm probably fifteen or twenty people back from the check-in when Bones slides
in behind me---cutting off at least 30 people. Nadine, Emma, and Addison join
in right behind. "Hey E." He claps me on the shoulder. "How's it hangin'?"

"The crutches are a pain in the butt, but otherwise, I'm good." After swiping
in, we deposit our bags at the first table we find and grab some food.

"Honestly," says Emma, once we've all returned to the table. "I feel like I
was far too worried about the first day of classes. My brother---he graduated
a couple of years ago---told me horrible stories about how the professors
like to make sure that you hit the ground running each term."

The upperclassmen exchange glances. The pair of them can barely hold in their
mirth. "Mostly, the professors aren't that hardcore to the frosh. Maybe if
you go off the deep end in the third term, you'll get screwed, but it's mostly
a story that us juniors and seniors use to scare pups like you."

"'Member when you were convinced that we'd have an exam on the first day,
Bones?"

"Yeah, during orientation, my RA went on a tirade against my Calc professor,
saying how horrible she was and that she always tried to weed out her classes
by giving us a super-hard exam on the first day of class."

"Of course she was lovely---super supportive and a really good lecturer.
Absolutely the opposite of what Kevin told us."

"That was his name, by the way."

"Yeah," said Emma. "That was pretty easy to guess."

"And how about you, E?" Nadine asks. "Have you encountered any terrifying
teachers?"

"No. But one kid did end up in my Materials Science class by mistake. When
the professor encouraged anyone not there for her specific class, they looked
*so* terrified and embarresed.



Chapter Playlist
----------------

During the first couple of weeks of classes, Ellie's playlist has an almost
cinematic feel. Whether or not that had any bearing on her attitude during the
chapter is for you to decide. Tee-hee.

It was made by her High School friend, Kelsie.
