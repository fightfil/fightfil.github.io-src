# Prologue

*August 13, Atlanta, GA --* Today, after a long labor dispute between the NBA
and the NBPA, the league and player's union jointly made the decision to have
the league undergo a drastic restructuring. The new commissioner encouraged all
of the owners to divest their stock in their teams--giving them the option to
purchase another team during the auction that will occur later this month. The
league has also decided to detach every player from their current team and allow
for a fantasy-style, league-wide draft. This will occur three days after the
auction finishes (a three day event in its own right), which will present a
large challenge for potential ownership teams and their future front offices.

## The Auction
*August 24, New York, NY --* All thirty teams are up for grabs at this event.
Madison Square Garden is packed with onlookers ready to see billionaire
coalitions spend lavish sums to help restart American Pro Basketball.

### Day 1

1. First up for grabs is the Orlando team, dubbed the Mystics in this new league.
One of the 20 largest media markets in the nation, the Mystics are likely to
get a reasonable amount of attention. All teams start bidding at about $150
million, so none of them are going to sell for chump change. The first bidder on
the Mystics opened with $400 million, so it's definitely going to be a big night
for the league. In no time at all a high-water mark was settled on, selling the
team to the highest bidder at a hair over $680 million. A small investment
group led by a up-and-coming tech guru, Johnny Mosley, are the ones
to spring for the first team of the night. In his short
speech to accept the team he stressed how important building the right kind of
organization was to him. He said that Orlando had had too many stars up and
leave in its history, and he wanted to build a team that would contend the right
way.

1. Second, the New Orleans Cranes. New Orleans, despite its immense culture and
beautiful location, isn't a comparatively large market, and since the teams
aren't coming with rosters, only the potential earning potential and franchise
history are really important at this juncture. Bidding only reached about $280
for the Cranes. Sebastian Florence, a high profile media mogul in the southeast,
won the team, pledging to do whatever was necessary to build a contender. He
says he understands that good teams take time and investment, but that he's
dedicated to having a valuable product at all times. 

1. Third the Phoenix Beams. The bidding is reaching $750 million, almost $70
million more than what Orlando sold for. The leading candidate today is an
ownership group led by Yolda-Tech founder Adrian Anyan. The Boston-based startup
just had its IPO and he's valued at a Net Worth of just over $3 billion. After
several startups that have failed to gain traction in their first few years, he
finally struck it rich with Yolda-Tech. He's probably going to be a bit stingy
for a few years, until he starts having the lifestyle inflation that will come
with being an owner for so long, but until then, his desire to win and short
fuse will be at odds.

1. Then the Los Angeles Waves, deriving from the storied franchise of the Lakers
is projected to be one of the most valuable teams in the league. The first sale
to break a billion bucks, the Waves sold for just under $2.5 billion. The
owners, a group headed by Adrian Anyan's cousin, investment mogul Marcus Anyan,
seems share many of Adrian's qualities, an overiding desire to win, and win
now, with vastly deep pockets.

1. The Utah Blues. A **far** smaller market than the Waves in LA, the Blues sell
to powerful media giant Rodney Howard for around 550 million dollars.

    ***Author's Note:*** If you readers are interested in providing the ownership
    of the

1. Now for the Dallas Rangers. The first of the Texas teams sell for about
800 million dollars. The value of a championship banner seems to be quite
tangible.

1. The Atlanta Eagles are next.

    Carlyle Jeffries, a diversified business mogel in the Deep South, was
    willing to open his purses pretty wide to purchase the Eagles for about
    550 million dollars. For Carlyle, winning seems to be the top

1. Now we have the Minnesota Coyotes.

1. Up next we go to PDX, for the Pioneers.

1. Up to Canada now, we have the Toronto Dinos.

1. It's Milwaukee up next.

1. The Golden State Spartans are next.

### Day 2
1. To the city of Brotherly Love for the Philadelphia Freedom.

1. Now we have the Brooklyn Hoops.

1. The Denver Peaks are next.

1. Detroit is up, who is going to buy the gears.

1. Now we go back to LA, for the Riders.

1. In the nation's capitol, we are now at the Washington Americans.

1. Now the team that lives in this arena, the Metros are for sale.

1. To Oklahoma we go, to sell the Twisters.

1. Now we have an East Coast team: Who is going to acquire Boston's luck of the
Irish? The team with the most championship banners in the history of the league,
along with a reasonably large media market goes for just under two billion
dollars. But the new ownership group's outlook seems to be at odds with the
hefty price tag for the team. Their speech focused on getting the best product
and ensuring sustainability, even at the expense of continuity and winning.

### Day 3
1. To Florida we go, who wants the Miami Burn?

1. The heart of Basketball is for sale: the Indiana Racers are up next.

1. Now to the city of Jazz; who's going to buy the Memphis Roar?

1. Now for Chicago, who wants the Bison?

1. San Antonio Outlaws are next.

1. Sacramento Royals are up.

1. To Ohio, with the Cleveland.

1. Houston Blast next.

1. And lastly, we go to North Carolina and sell the Wasps.

## Introducing Nora
When Adrian Anyan bought the Beams, I didn't think much of it. I'd never
even been to Arizona. But I did my first internship with Adrian back when
he was just a project lead at Google, and was like his third hire when he 
started Yolda. We'd been pretty good friends throughout the process and
his IPO had made me pretty wealthy too. I guess when it started blowing
up on social media, my main reaction was more of the "Hey, I guess I now
know an NBA owner. That's neat," variety rather than having wild fantasies
about what that'd mean.

Like, I'm a basketball nut, don't get me wrong, but besides a co-op I did
at Draft Kings during the year after working at Google with Adrian, I'd had
very little qualifications to even base such a fantasy off. That's why,
when I did get the call from Adrian late that night, I was totally unprepared.

"Hey Nora."

"Holy shit, congrats on buying the Beams!"

"Thanks."

"I didn't even know that you were there."

"Yeah, I didn't think it was going to happen, but five or so others helped me
to form an ownership group and we found the capital to do it."

"Well, it's still amazing."

"So I know that you are enjoying your job right now, but I also know how much
you enjoyed that co-op with Draft Kings. When you talked about the analytics
tools you helped develop there, I was really impressed. You'd be a wonderful
help on the team if you want to join. I have a assistant GM position open for
you."

At this moment, I'm pretty sure I spluttered indeciferably for about ten
minutes. I was so out of my depth here that I was on the verge of laughing
hysterically. I couldn't believe that anything that was happening was real.
But then again, I also was sure that this situation was so outlandish that I
wouldn't have been able to think it up if weren't.

So I just acted as reasonably as I could under the circumstances, by seriously
thinking about what I'd heard. "Wow. That's a lot. You know that GMing is a 
lot more than just choosing the best players and throwing money at them, right?"

"That's why I'm not giving you the full position, just the assistantship."

"I'm still going to be *so* far out of my depth. Think a prarie dog in the
middle of the Mariana's Trench."

"But you want the job."

"Of course I want the damn job. What basketball junkie with no hope of going
pro doesn't want to be in fucking management for the NBA? But you can do far
better than me."

"I don't think so."

"Fuck off."

"But you're taking the job."

"If it'll make you hang up."

"It will."

"OK then, I'll take the job."

"Bye Now."

"Go away."


## The Re-Draft
*August 30, Brooklyn, NY --* Just like a normal draft, we're back at the
Barclay's Center with a sold-out crowd eagerly awaiting their team's picks.
Unlike normal, however, all four hundred-plus league calibre players will be up
for grabs. The draft order for this event is the same as the order of the
auctions.

## Post-Draft Meetings

"Nora, Eddie, this is our new Head Coach, Ryan Thomas."

"Welcome to the Beams, Ryan. We're excited to have you on board."

"Thank you very much."

"So what to do you think of the roster right now."

"We should be a dangerous team come playoffs, as long as we aren't hit by a
serious injury. And with the age of some of our best players, that is a serious
worry."

I give an cold, pointed, glare to Dave.

"Kevin McCall was a wonderful pickup for the first round. He's a great leader.
On the court, no one will stop him on offense so we should be basically set.

"While Long is a great player, I'm worried about his age. He's thirty-six and 
is in his 19th year on the court. He can't have much gas left. He was among the
best in the old league, but his strength is waning.

"I love Fernando Murray. He's a drive and kick guard who plays excellent D. All
of these guys have excellent personalities."

"That was one of our focuses during the draft," Dave says, a smug grin on his
face.

"I'm also worried about Odie. He didn't even play basketball in a Rec League
during the lockout, because he underwent three different surguries. Just watch
out and make some contingency plans.


## The Trade

> @Beams send @BigOJeff & @BrettLong to @Hoops for @Hoya33 and first round pick
> #DumbSalaryDump
> 
> -- Adrian Wojnarowski (@WojVerticalNBA)

"Why the FUCK am I discovering that we traded away two starters on TWITTER!?
Dave, what do you have to say for yourself?"

"You and Nora were telling me that the risk that they would miss significant
amount of time was high, and that they were going to eat a lot of cap space for
the next two years."

"So you gave them away for a bench player and a first-rounder." I said,
more of a statement rather than a question.

"I made some calls, and the Hoops were one of the few teams even willing to take
on one of their contracts, let alone both."

"You then decided to pull the trigger immediately, without consulting me, Nora,
or any other of the five members of your staff?"

"Yes."

"Why the FUCK?" Eddie's usually calm demeanor had blown out of the stadium. He
was nearly bouncing off the wals, his face redder than a tomato.

"Because if I informed you, I wouldn't have had the freedom to make the
decision. You and your fucktoy here," He gestured to me, "have been criticising
and overriding me from day one. I don't feel like I'm being given the freedom
to make my own decisions."

"Um," I piped up, "You've been the sole mover for every single major decision
so far. You made each of the draft picks, chose our coaching staff, trainers,
and now you've made this decision. Each time, you listened to our input, then
went off and made your decision. Except this last one. You just traded our two
highest paid players."

"You need to get off your high fucking horse, Nora. You haven't half the 
experience as any of my other assistants, and you only have this job because--"

"You hold right there, before you say anything else you'll regret."

"Becaue you're fucking Pratt."

"Get out." Eddie's voice had dropped from the screaming it was before to a low,
cold, growl. If he was angry before, he was ten times worse now. "You can
clean out your office tomorrow."

"Wha--"

"You're fired."

*September 11, Phoenix, AZ --* According to sources within the teams, Guard
Brett Long, picked with the 58^th^ overall pick in the re-draft and Center Odie
Jefferson, picked with the 123^rd^ pick, have been traded to the Brooklyn Hoops
for SG Guillermo Hoya and the team's first round pick this year.

As obvious a salary dump as this is, everyone can see--in a basketball 
sense--how transparently bad this trade is. They traded two starters on what 
many people said was the second-best (on paper, at least) team in the conference
for a first round pick and a player who isn’t going to start for them this year.

Now that you’re aware of how objectively bad the trade is, let’s look into why 
it happened. The Beams’ GM David Amison picked the 36 year-old Long in the 
second round of the re-draft. Long, whose career was long and storied in the 
old league, played 11 games last season, coming back from a torn ACL.

## The Firing

*September 13, Phoenix, AZ --  Vi Kallic -- Phoenix Sun:* In a press conference
today, Beams owner Eddie Pratt informed us of the firing of GM Dave Amison.

> While we regret causing such turmoil to the organization so quickly after
> getting settled here, Mr. Amison's conduct was completely unprofessional,
> detrimental to the team, and unacceptable in general. We have voided our

"Worked closely," my butt. This is just a simple, and poorly disguised,
instance of favoritism. He obviously has enjoyed more than just the pleasure
of working with her in the past, and is using that to ensure that he has better
control over the front office.

She's nothing more than a figure-head and eye candy, I mean look at that.
Granted, Amison was about as incompetent as you can get during the re-draft, so
she can't be **much** worse than he was.

How long will it be before she files a sexual harassment suit against someone
in the organization (or against a winning opponent)?

# 2014-2015 season

## Week 1



**November 7: \@ Hoops (2-0):**  W 86-75

We take the Hoops down behind strong defense and good 3 point shooting. We shot
41% as a team from behind the arc (for 7 threes), actually a better percentage
than we shot from the field. **Ryan Wesley had 16 points, 5 rebounds and 6
assists** to lead the team to victory.

**Record:** 2-2

**Standing:** T-7 (9^th^) West, T-4 (5^th^) Pacific

## Week 2

**November 8: @ Indiana (2-0):** L 121-131

**31 points, 10 assists and 4 rebounds from Ryan Wesley** aren't enough to hold
down the Racers, who had 6 players in double figures (we did have seven, so...)
and SG Antonio Hayes, who scored 34 on 18 shots.

**Record: 2-3**

**November 10: @ Chicago (0-5):** L 86-102

On another off night we fail to shoot 40% from the field, with **Wesley leading
the way with only 19 points and 5 assists.** His defense was also lacking as he
allowed opposing PG to go for 19 and 10, with only 1 turnover. We were picked
apart in the 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ period as the Bison pick up their first win of the
season.

**Record: 2-4**

**November 11: @ Milwaukee (3-3):** W 119-114

**Ryan Wesley had the league-wide highest score of the night, with 46 points,
six assists, and 8 rebounds.** Milwaukee seemed to be controlling the game
right from opening tip, leading by 20 at the beginning of the 4^th^. Forward
Ryan Herrera had 43 points on 50% shooting, which, on any other night, would
have been enough. Our starting lineup averaged a plus-minus of +15.

**Record: 3-4**

**November 13: vs Memphis (4-3):** L 124-130 (OT)

**Ryan Wesley was one rebound away from his first triple-double this season: He
had 30 points, 11 assists, and 9 rebounds (only 1 TO, too).** He pushed us back
from a 12 point deficit at half to force overtime. But it all is for naught as
the Roar push hard in overtime, and drop some points over us. Their point guard
Eric Wright, was able to score 22 with 13 dimes and 3 steals.

**Record: 3-5**
