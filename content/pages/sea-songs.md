*Sea Songs* is about an idyllic summer camp on a Maine island where aspiring writers,
actors, and artists of all varieties can spend the summer learning from each other,
building connections, and talking with some of the high flyers in each of their
fields, all while enjoying top-notch hospitality. Except, as is often true, when
main character Rebekah Coombs is gifted a summer there, she discovers that the
secretive program has many hidden truths.

Enjoy the ride as you accompany Rebekah on her surprise journey into a world that
is about as far from ordinary as it appears. Watch as the aspiring screenwriter is
thrust into what could easily have been a film.

# Characters

As with all of my projects, this page will serve as a landing point for you to find
out about the world and people of the story in ways that will never make it into
the chapters. Here are the characters of *Sea Songs*:

**Rebekah Coombs**
:   Rebekah is from Reading, Pennsylvania, where the monopoly location inspired
    6 year-old Rebekah to write her first script. As she grew, her intrest in writing
    and film grew with her, and she enrolled at Moriavian College to study Creative
    Writing and Film after high school.

    This ordeal starts when she recieves a letter after the end of her sophomore year,
    inviting her to this summer program for the creative arts.

# Settings

Like *The Penultimate Step*, *Sea Songs* is set in a present-day, basically real,
version of our own world. So therefore, it's settings are mostly real, except
for a few.

## The Sea School

**The Sea School of Creativity** is a fairly secretive institution. Located on
a Maine island a few miles out towards the sea.
