[TOC]

This summer, I found a ton of fun webcomics: *OMG! Check, Please!*, *Rain*,
and many more, and I felt that I needed to try my hand at making a similar
style of story. *The Penultimate Step* is about Ellie Carver, a transgender
High Jumper at a fictional engineering school in southern Connecticut.

# [Characters](./characters/)

As far as characters go, *TPS* is my most ambitious project to date. It has
a **ton** of characters. Here are some of the more important characters that
you'd have met so far as you read along.

[Ellie Carver]({filename}./characters/ecarver.md)
:   Ellie is the primary protagonist of this story. Born in Rockport, ME, (as
    Ethan) she's battled her gender identity all through middle and high school.
    After coming out to her high school during her graduation, she starts all
    over again as a track and field athlete at the 
    [ISTU](#the-igor-sikorski-technical-university).

    In high school, (known as Ethan), Ellie was a track and field athelete,
    primarily participating in the high jump. After clearing 5'10" partway
    through sophomore, Ellie---then Ethan---began to attract some mild attention
    from mid-teir Division I schools. However, during the first meet
    of the outdoor season that year, she tore her quad. The next year, back
    from injury, the recruiters' interest waned---Ellie was only jumping about
    5'6"---so people returned to ignoring the skinny kid from Bumfuck, Maine.

    Always seen as a bit of a special case---obviously smart and hardworking,
    but not particularly high-achieving, Ellie's differences wore on her and
    the shy, awkward, but interesting kid became more withdrawn from her peers.
    Her once upbeat demeanor also shifted; she smiled less, her temper
    shortened, and her moods were deeper. To top it off, one of her hometown
    neighbors committed suicide on the Fourth of July, during the after her
    sophomore year.

    This event triggered something in her, as she realized how close to 
    becomeing *that* kid she was. Already aware of her bisexual orientation,
    she wasn't afraid of it, like many people could be with their sexualities,
    but she also knew that something else was up. She refused to accept that
    her depression was just born from her inadequecies, that the only thing
    that differed her from the happy 11^th^ graders around her was that they
    were neurotypical. So she spent much of the summer being all introspective
    and shit.

    Coming to realize that meant something that in a significant portion, if not
    a majority, of her dreams, the point-of-view was that of a female, instead
    of her designated gender, she determined that she was uncomfortable with the
    changes to her body that came with male puberty. Armed with this newfound
    knowledge, she did the only reasonable thing. She discovered it,
    internalised it, and buried it, as deep within herself as she could bury
    something so shameful (in her perspective).

    Senior year came along and she made friends with a couple sophomores who
    were new to Exeter. After a couple of months, before the Thanksgiving
    vacation, she told them who she was. And their support kicks off the
    events of the story.

[Kyle Talbott]({filename}./characters/ktalbott.md)

:   Kyle is one of Ellie's suite-mates, from Boulder, CO.

[Theodore (Theo) Welk]({filename}./characters/twelk.md)

:   The son of the founder of Welk Enterprises, a tech transnational out of
    Stamford, CT, Theo was in a band in high school, but felt abandoned when
	his friends chose to push him away as they were accepted to different
	colleges. 

[Howard Lyons]({filename}./characters/hlyons.md)

:   Senior, sprinter, silly. Howard is the RA for Ellie's floor, and was one
    of the guides during Ellie's recruitment as an athelete before her freshman
	year.

[Emma Giles]({filename}./characters/egiles.md)

:   A fellow first-year on the jump-squad in track, Emma shares Ellie's feeling
    of being an outclassed fish out of water on the team, consistenly jumping
    the worst of the girls on the team.
    
    But she and Ellie hit it off, and hang around a bit while not studying or
    working out.
    
    Emma is from Groton, CT, and graduated 4th in her class at Groton High
    School.

[Addison James]({filename}./characters/ajames.md)

:   Mr. Two First Names, Addison is the best jumper on the team---he has a
    chance of reaching 7 feet before he graduates. A fellow first year and
    English Minor, Ellie has a teeny bit of a crush on him, but hides it.

[Natalie Mesker]({filename}./characters/nmesker.md)

:   Natalie is Emma's roommate. She is a Mechanical Engineering major, and hails
    from Glastonbury, CT. 
    
    Over the years, Natalie has dated a string of the most desirable men
    avalaible. In high school, she dated the captains of the Football team, the
    Basketball team, and the Crew team (which was really the most popular sport 
    at Glastonbury High).
    
    Before she even started at the ISTU, she was already entertaining some of
    the finest hunks available at the school. However, her revolving door of
    dates began to include something new---women.

[Diane Mesker]({filename}./characters/dmesker.md)

:    Natalie's twin sister (who is not identical, don't worry) is not nearly as
     fun as the (five minutes) older girl, as most might say. Where Natalie 
     excels at studying socially and learns best in groups, Diane would rather
     immerse herself in a book and absorb the information on her own. Similarly,
     while Natalie might be seen at every single party in one night, Diane might
     not leave her room the whole weekend.
     
     On the other hand, she is far more athletic than her ocasionally clutzy
     sister. She was recruited for the school's basketball team, and figures to 
     be their star. She turned down a full scholarship offer from a Division I
     school in order to come here and be with her sister---who, despite their
     differences, she adores (the feeling is mutual).
     
     Diane studies Robotics Engineering, with a focus in Biotechnology.

     Her face isn't what anyone would call flawless, but it exudes some measure
     of beauty, without being exotic or even amazonian. It just fits *her*. The
     high cheeks and bushy eyebrows are perfect frames for her eyes,

[Jennifer (Jen) Goldman]({filename}./characters/jgoldman.md)

:   Jen is from Poughkeepsie, New York: Her mom is a professor of history at
    Marist College.

# Settings

Being a project set in a mostly truthful mirror of the real world, there aren't
as many entirely new places and things to review, but I do have to work harder to
fit them into the story's world.

## The Igor Sikorski Technical University

The **Igor Sikorksy Technical University** (ISTU) is a private research
university in Orange, Connecticut, focusing on engineering sciences and other
applied disciplines.

Founded in 1978 in Orange, the ISTU was founded by the then CEO of United
Technologies, which was the parent company of Stravinsky Aircraft. The
company was in the midst of diversifying into high tech fields outside their
original field of aerospace. United Technologies founded the school in the
hopes of creating a talent incubator to source engineers from.

### History
United Technologies bought the 176-acre plot of land that the university now
lies within because of its proximity to Yale's West Campus, and the inability
to acquire anything within either New Haven or West Haven. In 1976, the
Corporation's board of directors voted narrowly to create the university,
and its funding was controversial through the early years of the institution,
when student tuitions, grants, and endowments were unable to independently
support it. The first buildings were built later that year (Goodfellow Hall,
The Xavier Center, and Slocum Laboratories), and the initial faculty were hired
in time to start recruiting students for the 1978-79 academic year.

Around 60% of its early graduates started working directly for United
Technologies but in 1990, the institution determined that it could be financially
independent and the board voted to oust the current university president, who
was a representative of United Technologies. The new president worked to further
expand, and especially round out the university's offerings.

Between 1990 and 2000, the university grew drastically in size as new majors
were added, the humanities department was fleshed out and new constructions
added academic buildings and dorms. Aggressive marketing and outreach programs
started attracting potential students from around the country and world.

Today, its graduate program is completing its own expansion phase. Graduate
degrees are primarily granted in its three primary engineering fields,
aerospace, mechanical, and robotics engineering.

### Campus

The ITSU Campus is a gated campus off Marshal Hill Road in Orange. With a main
road that goes eastward down to Indian Lake, where it loops back on itself,
the campus is divided into northern and southern halves.

Buildings on the ITSU campus are built with a blend of modern and gothic
architectural styles. The imposing gothic stone- and brick-work is contrasted
by large windows and open spaces.

The oldest parts of campus were built close to the lake. These buildings are now
underclassmen dormitories, the Mathematics department, General sciences, and
the main humanities building. Also located on the west side, are the auditorium
and concert hall and competitive gymnasium.

### Academics

The ISTU specializes in engineering and the applied sciences, but also has a
general liberal arts major for those who attend the university, but decide that
neither engineering nor the sciences are right for them.

One key feature in the academic plan at the ISTU is that students are expected
to choose a focus, or concentration, for their major. A computer science student
might, for example, choose to focus on Security, or Artificial Intelligence, and
be required to take several classes in that specific field. But that student
might instead to focus on Aerospace, or Biotech, and then that would shape their
degree by requiring them to take several classes that would otherwise be outside
their major.

The academic year is split into three trimesters, the first lasting from
the first week of September to Thanksgiving. The second trimester starts after
the new year, and the third trimester lasts from after spring break in the
middle of March to Memorial Day weekend. There is also a summer term, but most
students opt to either pursue summer internships, co-ops, or study abroad
programs during that term.

Borrowing from the WPI Plan, the ISTU also implements a project-based
curriculum. However, the ISTU requires that all projects be with a domestic
project center---global project are discouraged. The ISTU requires that all
engineering students complete a humanities project in their chosen humanities
concentration, as well as a senior capstone project in their major field.

Students may count co-op work towards this project requirement, provided that
they can properly document and present their project, and that said project
can find approval from the department's advisors. Thus students may be able to
earn money while finishing up this degree requirement.

### Rankings and Reputation

Being a much newer school than top-tier engineering schools like WPI, RPI, and
MIT, the ISTU hasn't developed the same type of notoriety as those more famous
east coast engineering universities. However, most rankings, especially in
regards to return on investment (the ISTU has a tuition about 30% lower than any
of these schools), tend to place the school very much on par with the Big 3.

Its undergraduate acceptance rate is just under 35%, with about 3800 applicants
per year. The first year class averages around 550 students, (which is a very
high 42% committal rate), so the school is very adept at finding the students
who will end up going there in both the application phase and the admission
phase.

### Student Life

The ITSU campus is made up of a geographically and demographically diverse set
of students, while still maintaining a strong focus on domestic students, rather
than attracting as many international students as schools like MIT or Yale.

Unlike many engineering schools, it holds creating a gender balance in the
highest priority, and even had a makeup of 52% women for the class of 2014.
Overall, however, the balance is closer to 46% women, which still is abnormal
in comparison to many other technical universities.

There are just under one hundred fifty officially sanctioned clubs on campus,
focusing on areas ranging from club sports like Fencing and Ultimate Frisbee, to
Student Professional Societies, to community service and outreach clubs.

All students are guaranteed housing throughout all four years. 95% of freshman,
and 85% of upperclassmen choose to avail themselves of the on-campus housing
options,
