title: The Voltun Collection

**Voltun** is less of a single story but a world in which a number of my stories exist.
The current incarnation of Princess of the Insane actually is technically a Voltun
story, but the main things that I'm working on in this world is the story of Zephra
Helmb, which is, as yet, untitled.


# Princess of the Insane

*Princess of the Insane* is a project I started in my junior year of high school,
during a mystery novel program at school. We read a bunch of early 20th century
mysteries, a lot of Sherlock Holmes, Hercule Poirot, Miss Marple, etc. Part of the
class was to create our own mystery story. So I wrote my first draft of Princess.
It was pretty bad, but was the longest project I had written to date, weighing in at
22k words. I liked the ideas, even if my execution was terrible, so I rewrote it 
over the next 3 years.

By the middle of Sophomore year at university, the rewrite hit the 45000 word mark,
but I really had no Idea of where I was going to go from there, so I put it on the 
backburner and started trying other things.
